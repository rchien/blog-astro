This blog is a record of my journey to a become better developer and
entrepreneur. As a geek passionate about software development, my goal
is to create value through software. On this journey I hope to share
with you solutions to technical, business and as always, people
problems.

While I hope I succeed in overcoming most of the challenges, I will
not be stingy in sharing my failures as well. This will be a journey
of many ups and downs. Hope you enjoy the ride. Through this blog I
hope to offer original ideas and solutions to problems encountered
building products. Of course original problems are hard to come by so
expect content that simply offer another perspective if not improve
upon existing solutions. Since my ultimate goal is to build my own
business, there will be content on project/time management, ideas, and
everything entrepreneurship related.
